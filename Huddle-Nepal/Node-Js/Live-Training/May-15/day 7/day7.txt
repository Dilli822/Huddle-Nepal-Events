//# Database(DB)
     - Data (Digital Age) vs old age style database management
     - A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically
       in a computer system.

// DBMS(Database Management System)
     - It is a software/program that manages, organizes, controls our database.
     - eg: MYSQL, Oracle, PostgressSQL etc.

// Communicating with Database
     - To Communicate with the Database, we use query language named as structured query language(SQL)

     - Creation of database table
     CREATE TABLE table_name(name varchar(20), address varchar(30));

// CRUD Operation in Database (Main operation we perform with DB)
    - C - Create , R- Read, U- update, D- Delete

// Data storing format in DB(schema-structured)
  Tables     or    JSON(Tree Format, GRAPH, key value pairs)
  SQL             NoSQL
  Relational      Non-Relational


// Association Mechanism in Relational Database
   - keys used for identity of data relational like foreign key,composite, primary key
   - Relational DB are related to eachother having fixed structure


//   SQL                      VS          NoSQL
   Relational DB                       Non-Relational DB
   Pre-defined schema                  Dynamic schema
   Based on ACID Properties            Based on BASE Properties
   Table Based schema                  key-value, graph-based schema
   Good for complex queries            Not good for complex queries(no fixed-schema)

// Database Drivers or ORM to connect Database from Programming Language.
// We integrate associated library/dependecy/plugin associated with database in our application and hence perform query.

// ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
      - An ORM library is a completely ordinary library written in our language of choice 
        to Communicate DB in shortcut way in a OOP way.
        eg: for python - python - Django ORM || Java orm - hibernate ||   Javascript -sequelize
